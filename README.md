This application allows you to easily manage a ToDo list of currently screening and upcoming movies! At present, it only has the above-mentioned features, but in the future, we plan to add:

- A recommendation feature based on the trends of movies you've watched
- Displaying showtimes at nearby theaters using location information
- Statistical information such as the number of times you've watched a movie and the frequency (wouldn't it be nice to know how much of a movie buff you are?)

**Thank you for your support!**
